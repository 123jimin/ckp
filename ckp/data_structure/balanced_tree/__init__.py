"""
    This package contains implementations of various balanced tree data structures.
    Usually, performance of "linked-list-like" data structures on Python is absymal, so using these data structures is not recommended.
    For example, to maintain a list of sorted elements, check `ckp.data_structure.sorted_containers`.
    Still, these could be useful for both educational purposes, and for rare cases when you do need to use them.
