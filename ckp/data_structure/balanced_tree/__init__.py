"""
    This package contains implementations of various balanced tree data structures.

    Usually, other data structures such as `ckp.data_structure.sorted_containers` are preferred, as performance of pointer-based data structures on Python is absymal.
    Still, these could be useful for both educational purposes, and for rare cases when you do need to use them.
