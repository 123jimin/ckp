# Graph Theory

`ckp.graph_theory` contains implementations of algorithms on graphs.

- Graph data structures are under `ckp.data_structure.graph`, not under `ckp.graph_theory`.
- For tree-specific algorithms, check [the documentation on `ckp.graph_theory.tree`](./tree.md).

While following algorithms currently use recursion, replacing them with manual stack management is planned.
