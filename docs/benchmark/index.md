# Benchmarks

Multiple solutions using CKP have been submitted and accepted on [BOJ](https://www.acmicpc.net/). I continuously attempt to find ways to make my code place a better position on the Python leaderboard.

## Current Results

## Note

### Primality Testing

- primality 0.0.6 gives false positives for several integers, such as 318665857834031151167461 or 3317044064679887385961981.
- SymPy 1.13.3 uses Baillie-PSW primality testing for very large values.
